Inspired by [Zach Holman](https://zachholman.com), I made [feedback repository](https://github.com/ZDroid/feedback). That's a quick little **ask-me-anything** repository.

**Issues** = **questions** in feedback repository. You can ank new question with submitting new issue. I will answer to it as quick as possible, so please don't send me mails / tweets to note that I need to answer.

Please be constructive and don't ask *stupid* things.

Tweet to me if you have something quick ans easy.
